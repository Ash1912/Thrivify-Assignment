# Habit Tracker Web Application

This is a Habit Tracker web application that allows users to track their daily, weekly, or monthly habits, receive suggestions, and view their progress in a user-friendly dashboard. It consists of a frontend built with React and a backend built with Node.js and Express, with a Flask-based API for habit suggestions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to register and log in (if implemented).
- **Habit Tracking**: Users can create habits with specific titles and frequencies (daily, weekly, or monthly).
- **Habit Suggestions**: AI-based habit suggestions based on user data.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles (if implemented).
- **Responsive Design**: Works well across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Axios for API requests, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MySQL (or SQLite)
- **AI API**: Flask server for habit suggestions
- **Database**: MySQL (or SQLite) for storing user and habit data

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **MySQL** or **SQLite** (depending on your preference)
- **Flask** (for the AI-based suggestions API)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ash1912/Thrivify-Assignment.git
   cd habit-tracker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your database:

->Create a MySQL database or use SQLite.
->Import the required schema for Users and Habits.

4. Run the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Your backend should now be running at 
    ```bash
    http://localhost:5000
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. Update the API URL in api.js (if necessary) to match the backend URL:
    ```bash
    const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000/api"; // Update this URL
    const AI_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5001"; // Flask server URL for AI-based suggestions
    ```

3. Run the frontend:
    ```bash.
    npm start
    ```

4. Your frontend should now be running at 
    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

### AI Service Setup

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ai-service
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install flask
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the AI server:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. The AI server should now be running at
    ```bash
    http://localhost:5001
    ```
